            Akshay Kumar has become one of the first Bollywood stars to address the high cost of movie outings in India currently. Speaking recently at the Hindustan Times Leadrship Summit, the actor admitted that the film industry needs to ‘dismantle’ the existing system and ‘start all over again’ if it wants to win the audience back. He emphasised on the need to lower the cost of movie outings and said he would want to lower his fees for that as well.
